# json-rest-api
An Elm application often needs to implement CRUD operations through a JSON REST API. The HTTP requests and list manipulation involved in this communication can tend to be very similar, and writing the resulting boilerplate code, while not overly difficult, can still be time-consuming.

This package makes the most common cases easier to implement.

**json-rest-api** provides two modules of simple helper functions:

- `Request` - for constructing URLS, encoding resources as JSON, and sending HTTP requests.
- `Response` - for using a response to update a `List` of resources.

## Assumptions

This package makes several assumptions about communication with your REST API:

- The JSON body representing a resource, sent in the request and received in the response, can be successfully decoded with the same `Decoder`.
- Successful responses from your API include JSON in the body. *Note: 204 (No Content) responses may be handled in a future version.*
- A collection of resources in your client application is represented as a `RemoteData Http.Error (List resource)`.
- Resources are managed with the following HTTP verbs:
    - A list of resources is fetched with a `GET`, and it replaces the current list if successfully returned.
    - A resource is created with a `POST`, and it is added to the list if successfully returned.
    - A resource is updated with either a `PUT` or `PATCH`, and it replaces an existing resource in the list if successfully returned.
    - A resource is deleted with a `DELETE`, and it removes an existing resource in the list if successfully returned.
- Error responses should not modify the list of resources.
- The `Http.Error` type is sufficient to represent error states.

## Usage
Define a collection of resources in your `Model` as a `RemoteData Http.Error (List resource)`:

```
type alias Model =
    { articles : RemoteData Http.Error (List Article)
    }
```

Define a `Config resource urlBaseData urlSuffixData` for the API you're going to use, including:

- A `Decoder` for your `resource` type
- An `encode` function for your `resource` type
- A `toBaseUrl` for creating the URL to be requested, using your `urlBaseData` type
- A `toSuffix` for creating the URL suffix (used for PUT/PATCH and DELETE requests for specific resources) from your `urlSuffixData` type (usually just the ID type of your resource)
- A `List` of optionsâ€”currently this package supports options for:
  - Adding request headers
  - Using the PATCH verb instead of the default PUT for updating a resource

```
import JsonRestApi.Request as Request
import JsonRestApi.Response as Response

articleApi : Request.Config Article () String
articleApi =
    Request.config
        { decoder = articleDecoder
        , encoder = encodeArticle
        , toBaseUrl = (\_ -> "http://www.example-api.com/articles")
        , toSuffix = (\id -> "/" ++ id)
        , options = []
        }
```

Make HTTP requests by calling the `Request` helper functions in your application's `update`, passing:

- The `Config`
- The `urlBaseData`, which can simply be a `()` if your base URL is static
- When necessary, a `resource` and `urlSuffixData` (data for creating the URL suffix)
- A `Msg` to be sent when the response arrives

```
update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        GetAllRequest ->
            ( model, Request.getAll articleApi () GetAllResponse )

        CreateRequest article ->
            ( model, Request.create articleApi article () CreateResponse )

        UpdateRequest article ->
            ( model, Request.update articleApi article () article.id UpdateResponse )

        DeleteRequest article ->
            ( model, Request.delete articleApi article () article.id DeleteResponse )
...
```

Update the `List` of resources in your `Model` by calling the `Response` helper functions in the response `Msg`s, passing:

- The `Result`
- The collection of resources
- When updating or deleting, an equality test function for comparing two resources (i.e. by ID)

```
...
        GetAllResponse result ->
            ( { model | articles = Response.handleGetIndexResponse result model.articles }, Cmd.none )

        CreateResponse result ->
            ( { model | articles = Response.handleCreateResponse result model.articles }, Cmd.none )

        UpdateResponse result ->
            ( { model | articles = Response.handleUpdateResponse result isSameArticle model.articles }, Cmd.none )

        DeleteResponse result ->
            ( { model | articles = Response.handleDeleteResponse result isSameArticle model.articles }, Cmd.none )
```
